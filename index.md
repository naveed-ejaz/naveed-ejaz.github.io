## Lecturer in Computer Science  
**Applied Multimodal Artificial Intelligence | Ulster University Belfast**

I am a **Lecturer in Computer Science at Ulster University Belfast**. My research focuses on **applied multimodal artificial intelligence for intelligent decision-making in healthcare, infrastructure, and societal systems**, with a strong emphasis on **real-world deployment, ethics, and impact**.

I have over 15 years of academic and research experience across the UK, Canada, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia, and have led or contributed to AI projects deployed in **healthcare, smart infrastructure, public services, and industry**.

### Research Focus

My work brings together **machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing, and data analytics** to develop AI systems that operate on **visual, textual, and spatio-temporal data** and support evidence-based decision-making.

**Core research themes**
- **AI for Health & Wellbeing**  
  Clinical decision support, healthcare workflows, and privacy-aware AI systems
- **AI for Smart Infrastructure & Planning**  
  Drone imagery analysis, road and infrastructure monitoring, and smart cities
- **Responsible AI for Safety & Society**  
  Online harms, violence and cyberbullying detection, explainable and ethical AI
- **Multimodal & Generative AI Systems**  
  Vision–language models, LLMs with RAG, edge and cloud-based AI deployment

### Research Impact

My research has resulted in **deployed AI systems** used by healthcare providers, public-sector organisations, and industry partners, including:
- Automated clinical documentation using large language models
- AI-driven infrastructure and land-resource monitoring from drone imagery
- Machine learning systems for clinical risk assessment
- AI-based talent matching and decision-support platforms
